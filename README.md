👋 Hey there! I'm Evandro Joucovski de Oliveira, a passionate developer from Brazil who's always chasing the next tech adventure.

👀 I'm hooked on exploring cutting-edge tools and turning ideas into code that makes an impact—whether it's building sleek apps or optimizing backend magic.

🌱 Right now, I'm diving deep into Java and React Native to craft cross-platform wonders, but my toolkit is packed with battle-tested skills: PHP, Java, Node.js, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Docker, Git, and SVN.

💻 I've got a knack for full-stack development, from whipping up dynamic web apps to containerizing deployments that scale effortlessly.

💞️ Open to collaborating on everything from open-source gems to private ventures—let's build something awesome together!
